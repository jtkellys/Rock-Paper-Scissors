# Rock-Paper-Scissors
- A text-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game
- This was made while playing Rock-Paper-Scissors with my 5-year old
- At the time I was working on WHILE loops and IF statements, so I decided to make the game using them specifically 
# Capabilities
- Play Rock-Paper-Scissors with the computer using a random generator to pick a string from a list
- The player and computer both select a choice, and then the program compares those values to determine a winner
- Afterwards, the score is incremented based off who won
- Lastly, the player can decide to either keep playing or quit the game
